        After graduating from UCLA, I took a massive detour and decided against
        attending law school in the fall. Instead, I enrolled in culinary
        school. <br />
        <br /> I studied at the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone in
        Napa Valley and the French Pastry School in Chicago. Since then, Iâ€™ve
        worked in a variety of restaurants, bakeries, and wedding cake shops.
        <br />
        <br /> Even before my professional training, I spent a great deal of
        time in the kitchen. My parents ran and owned a restaurant in during my
        early childhood. Growing up, I was in charge of cooking every night at
        home. During college, I probably spent more time baking cookies than
        studying for final exams.
